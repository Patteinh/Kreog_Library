# Kreog Library üìò

Welcome to **Kreog Library**.

This project is inspired by Axel-Tobias Schreiner's work on `Object-Oriented Programming in ANSI-C`, and it challenges you to apply object-oriented principles using the C language.

## Language and Tools üõ†Ô∏è

![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)

- **Language:** C
- **Compilation:** Via Makefile, including `re`, `clean`, and `fclean` rules.

## Project Overview üîé

The project aims to explore `object-oriented concepts in C`, a language traditionally not object-oriented. You will design and implement various types, containers, and object-oriented algorithms, focusing on encapsulation, types, objects, and C implementation.

### Key Concepts

- **Encapsulation:** Hiding the memory representation of a type and grouping related functions.
- **Types and Objects:** Systematically constructing and destroying objects with constructors and destructors.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Implementing classes, member functions, and class objects in C.

### Parts of the Project

1. **Reading:** Introduction to object-oriented concepts.
2. **Design:** Implementing an object design for C language.
3. **Implementation:** Building basic types, containers, and algorithms using the object-oriented approach.

### Exercises

- **Object Construction/Destruction:** Implement `new()` and `delete()` functions for object management.
- **Advanced Object Management:** Extend `new()` with variadic arguments and implement the `va_new()` function.
- **Basic Types Implementation:** Create classes for basic types like `Int`, `Float`, and `Char`, including arithmetic and comparison operations.
- **Generic Containers:** Develop containers like `Array` and `List` that can hold any object type.
